# PyDISORT3
Adapt pyDISORT to run the DISORT radiative transfer solver in python version 3.x.

The pyDISORT wrapper (for python v.2.x) is developed by chanGimeno: https://github.com/chanGimeno/pyDISORT

The DISORT fortran code was developed by Stamnes et al:
(1) K. Stamnes, SC. Tsay, W. Wiscombe and K. Jayaweera, Numerically
    stable algorithm for discrete-ordinate-method radiative
    transfer in multiple scattering and emitting layered media,
    Appl Opt 27 (1988) (12), pp. 2502â€“2509.
